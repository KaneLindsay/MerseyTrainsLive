## MerseyTrains Live Group Software Project
### About
This is the Group 33 COMP208 project 'MerseyTrains Live'.

MerseyTrains Live is a phone based application providing the user group (commuters and tourists) with live,
up-to date information on the location of trains on the MerseyRail network via an interactive map. 
This data will allow for greater ease of navigation on the network.

### Origin
The MerseyTrains Live app was created as a group submission for the second year Group Software Project module at the University of Liverpool. The app will be improved past the submission of the project.
