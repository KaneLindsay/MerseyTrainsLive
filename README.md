MerseyTrains Live Group Software Project

This is the Group 33 COMP208 project 'MerseyTrains Live'.

MerseyTrains Live is a phone based application providing the user group (commuters and tourists) with live,
up-to date information on the location of trains on the MerseyRail network via an interactive map. 
This data will allow for greater ease of navigation on the network.
